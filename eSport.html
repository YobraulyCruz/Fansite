    	<div id="main"><p>The second highest level of pro play in overwatch also known as the teir 2 scene is overwatch Contenders. Contenders is basically a breeding ground for potential Overwacth League talent and is very diverse in terms of regions. Their are currently seven different contenders regions which include contenders North America, South America, Australia, China, Europe, Korea, and Pacific. Players from different regions can compete in another regions contenders tournament but there is a 3 player limit per team so only half of your team can be from another region. Just like in Overwatch league, Contenders has yearly seasons and is currently in its 3rd season. Contenders may not be as profitable or popular as Overwatxch league, but is still a very high level of play and worth watching to see which players and teams you might see in the Overwatch League when new expansion teams are released.</p></div>

            	<div id="main"><p>The lowest and most underrated supported overwatch tournament or the teir 3 scene would be Open Division. Open division is a massive open tournament that true uprising stars can show off their potential and make a name for themselves. The top 4 teams in contenders get a chance to compete with better teams in a chance to become a contenders team. This is called contenders trials and can make or break your pro career since this is the lowerest level of overwatch that is officailly streamed by blizzard (open division is streamed by 3rd party channels only).</p></div>

            <div id="wrapper">
            	<div id="main"><p>The last source of pro play in overwatch would be jayne's tournament of future champions. This is an unfunded tournament on jayne's personal live stream he hosts that allows random teams to come together and play against anywhere from contenders teams to open division teams. This tournament is very good because its allows talent to be spotted very early and gives teams a chance to prove themselves against better teams.</p> </div>
