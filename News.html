	<h1>News sources</h1>
	<div id="wrapper1">	
<div id="text"><p>The first person on my list is Rob "Slasher" Breslau. He is known as the pioneer of Overwatch news sources due to his 100% track record and very professional twitter page for leaks and information. He has yet to be wrong on a single leak but also does alot of reporting and leaking for other games such as LoL, dota, CS:GO, etc... I highly recommend checking out his twitter if you are interested in eSports news ,drama, and leaks <a href="https://twitter.com/Slasher"target="_blank">here!</a></p></div>

    <div id="myklt"><p>Next Overwatch news source on my list is Michael "Mykl" Padilla aka kingMYKL. Mykl is an ex-overwatch pro player for his contenders team "Kungarna" now full time youtuber, twitch streamer, and Overwatch news source. He has a very solid track record but has not been in the game as long as slasher so he doesn't get all the scoops like slasher does but when he does report things they are 99% of the time true. Follow him on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/KING_mykL"target="_blank">here</a> i highly recommend you do so!</p></div>

    	<div id="halot"><p>My last overwatch news source that i trust would be Halo of thoughts. Halo of thoughts isnt as reliable of a news source as others and has started some drama in the past with mykl, but overall he does get most of his leaks right and isnt a bad news source at all compared to most others. I recommend checking him out <a href="https://twitter.com/haloofthoughts"target="_blank">here</a> if you like.</p></div>
